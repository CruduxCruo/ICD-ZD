IMMORAL CONDUCT - ZDOOM EDITION (Snarboo Branch)
By Hellser
Original Mod By Cory Whittle
Further changes by Snarboo

=========================================================================================
:INCOMING TRANSMISSION FROM CORY WHITTLE. DECEMBER 27th, 2002:

Immoral Conduct is designed to be played either as is, or with any of your favorite
wads. Immoral Conduct works just as well in Doom1 or Doom2, as well as Tnt or Plutonia.

I recommend trying your luck at the Hell Revealed wads using Immoral Conduct, as well
as Memento Mori 1 and 2, Requiem, Invasion 2, or any other level set you enjoy. Also
works very well with 2002ado, Darken, Darken2, Icarus, Biowar, Phoenix, Phobos,
Eternal Doom, Alien Vendetta, etc.
Hell, it works with any Vanilla or "Lite" Boom level or level set.

NOTE: Obviously works best with levels that DON'T use a lot of replacement sprites,
such as Ultdtv.wad or similar. Definitely won't work with existing conversions
like Hacx or Strain, Aliens TC, etc.

:INCOMING TRANSMISSION FROM HELLSER, NOVEMBER 20th, 2014:

I see that you wish to continue the work of Immoral Conduct, as made by Cory Whittle
and to that, I thank you. The following list is the things that I've done. However,
the decorate folder (actors) is a bit of a mess. I'll try to guide you.

Addendum:
Original conversion to decorate by Hellser. Any changes or additions by myself will be noted with comments in the code!
