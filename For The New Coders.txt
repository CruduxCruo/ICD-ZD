IMMORAL CONDUCT - ZDOOM EDITION
By Hellser
Original Mod By Cory Whittle

=========================================================================================
:INCOMING TRANSMISSION FROM CORY WHITTLE. DECEMBER 27th, 2002:

 Immoral Conduct is designed to be played either as is, or with any of your favorite
 wads. Immoral Conduct works just as well in Doom1 or Doom2, as well as Tnt or Plutonia.

 I recommend trying your luck at the Hell Revealed wads using Immoral Conduct, as well
 as Memento Mori 1 and 2, Requiem, Invasion 2, or any other level set you enjoy. Also
 works very well with 2002ado, Darken, Darken2, Icarus, Biowar, Phoenix, Phobos,
 Eternal Doom, Alien Vendetta, etc.
 Hell, it works with any Vanilla or "Lite" Boom level or level set.

 NOTE: Obviously works best with levels that DON'T use a lot of replacement sprites,
       such as Ultdtv.wad or similar. Definitely won't work with existing conversions
	   like Hacx or Strain, Aliens TC, etc.

 I see that you wish to continue the work of Immoral Conduct, as made by Cory Whittle
 and to that, I thank you. The following list is the things that I've done. However,
 the decorate folder (actors) is a bit of a mess. I'll try to guide you.
