<P>
Stored in sounds.ddf file or in the DDFSFX data lump. 
<p>
Sounds.ddf allows you to change the various sounds that are played as things happen in the game. Each entry consists of a unique name, enclosed in square brackets, plus a series of commands that specify the sound lump in the wadfile and the characteristics of how it's played.
<p>
Names should be descriptive of what the sound is and/or when it is used, and will be referred to in the other ddf files, such as weapons.ddf, attacks.ddf and things.ddf amongst others.

<B><FONT SIZE=+1>COMMANDS</font></b>
<p>
The commands used for sound entries are as follows:
<p>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2>
<TR><TH>COMMAND</TH><TH>TYPE</TH><TH>DESCRIPTION</TH></TR>

<TR><TD>LOOP</TD><TD>[boolean]</TD><TD>
Makes the sound play over and over again. The only place where this is
important is in sector moving, or when creating an ambient
sound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>LUMP_NAME</TD><TD>[lumpname]</TD><TD>
The name of the SFX lump in the wad file. Sound lumps usually start with
"DS", which must be included. </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>MAX_DISTANCE</TD><TD>[float]</TD><TD>
The maximum distance away from the sound where it can still be heard.
Used to make sounds that can only be heard when the player is close to
the source. </td></tr>

<TR><TD>PRECIOUS</TD><TD>[boolean]</TD><TD>
When TRUE, this sound would rather to keep playing instead of being
cut (by an equal priority or equal singularity sound).  Default is
FALSE.</td></tr>

<TR><TD>PRIORITY</TD><TD>[integer]</TD><TD>
Specifies how important the sound is. Lower priorities are more
important. If a sound channel cannot be found to play the sound on,
EDGE will look for a channel playing a less important sound and cut
it. 0 means the sound has highest priority, 255 means sound has lowest
priority.
<BR>(NOTE: this strange priority scheme may be fixed is a future
release of EDGE).</td></tr>


<TR><TD>SINGULAR</TD><TD>[integer]</TD><TD>
If a thing is making a noise with the same singularity it will be cut.
(See chainsaw).</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>VOLUME</TD><TD>[percentage]</TD><TD>
Sound volume</TD></TR>
