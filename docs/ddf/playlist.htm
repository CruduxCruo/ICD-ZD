<p>
Stored in the playlist.ddf file, or in the DDFPLAY data lump.
<p>
Playlist.ddf is used to define music entries in EDGE. Each entry begins with a unique reference number, in square brackets, and represents a piece of music that can be played at some point in the game. Either during a level, or as one of the intermission or title pieces of music. These entries are then referred to from the other ddf files, such as levels.ddf or game.ddf.

<p>NOTE: When using filenames, directories must be separated by / instead
  of the \ character which is normally used under Windows.  The reason
  is because the \ character has a special meaning in DDF: it is the
  escape character, and "\n" is used to put newlines into DDF strings.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Format</b></font></a>
<p>
Entries in playlist.ddf have the following format:
<p>
<table BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2>
<tr><td>
<blockquote>
<br>
<b>[ENTRY NUMBER] MUSICINFO=[TYPE]:[FORMAT]:[SONG NAME];</b>
<p>
</blockquote>
</td></tr>
</table>
&nbsp
<p>
Where each command is as follows:
<p>
<table BORDER=1  CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=1>
<tr><th>COMMAND</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr>

<tr><td>[ENTRY_NUMBER]</td><td>
A two digit number, used to reference this entry in games.ddf and level.ddf.</td></tr>


<tr><td>[TYPE]</td><td>
This can be either CD, MIDI, MUS, or OGG and should refer to the type of music source that is being used.</td></tr>

<tr><td>[FORMAT]</td><td>
If the music is in a wadfile, this must be LUMP, if the music is a file on the hard drive this must be FILE, or if it's a CD track, this must be TRACK.</td></tr>

<tr><td>[SONG NAME]</td><td>
Name of the actual file in the wadfile or on the hard drive, or the CD track number. Entries with an underscore "_" in <b>require</b> quotes around the name (e.g. "D_DEAD").</td></tr>

</table>
&nbsp
<p>
