<P>
Stored in the switch.ddf file or in the DDFSWTH data lump. 
<p>
switch.ddf allows you to change the animations shown when switches are activated. Each entry consists of a unique name, enclosed in square brackets, plus a series of commands that specify the on and off frames of animation and switching sounds.



<p>
Names should be descriptive of the background and switch textures, but are used in the map editor when adding switches to your maps, so should be no longer than 8 characters (without spaces).
